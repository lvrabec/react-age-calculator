- Responsive workflow
- [React] -JS



### What I learned

The process of building this project allowed me to get to know the intricacies of date manipulation in JavaScript and to refine my knowledge of managing state in React. Moreover, I became proficient in CSS, applying my existing knowledge to develop an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface. In the process of learning and applying these technologies, I realized that every step brought me closer to becoming a more proficient developer. This journey was more than just building an age calculator. It was also about embracing the opportunity to grow and utilizing the power of continuous learning throughout the coding process.
